# Scroll Shadows

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<date className="-mt-6 mb-8 block text-gray-400">April 22, 2024</date>

Scroll shadows are a visual effect often used to indicate that there is more content to be scrolled in a particular direction, usually beyond the current viewport.

Here is an interactive example of scroll shadows added to an especially long article:

<InteractiveArticleExample />

By the end of this post, we'll create a reusable component called `<ScrollShadows />` that can be used to easily add shadows to anything with overflowing content, such as articles, carousels, or lists. It'll be powered internally by `useScrollShadows()` — which is where we'll start our journey.

Ultimately our goal is to make the component as easy to use as:

```tsx
<ScrollShadows>
  <ul>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
</ScrollShadows>
```

<Important>
Before we start, let's determine the scope of our implementation with some **acceptance criteria**:

- Must support both starting and ending shadows
- Independently fade in & out in response to scrolling progression
- Must gracefully [no-op](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)>) if the container is not overflowing
- Entirely customizable via CSS

...and for extra credit:

- Support both horizontal and vertical scrolling containers

</Important>

With that said, let's begin!

## Getting Started

First we'll need to install our only dependency:

```zsh
npm install framer-motion
```

For those unfamiliar: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is an incredible library that enables developers to create performant animations for the web. It provides some useful hooks `useScroll` and `useTransform` which we'll ultimately leverage to achieve the desired effect.

<Note>
While it's certainly possible to create our own user-land `useScroll` implementation and remove the dependency altogether, Framer Motion will help us get started quickly with the added benefit of tracking and animating all of our values outside the React render cycle for optimized performance.

That said, using any animation library will add additional size to the
JavaScript bundle that will be served to your users. Make sure
you're okay with that trade-off!

</Note>

<Tip>
If bundle size is a concern, I'd recommend first exploring a fun (albeit limiting) [pure CSS solution](https://css-scroll-shadows.vercel.app/) to see if that fits your needs.

</Tip>

## Tracking scroll progress

Our first objective is to listen to scroll events in the overflowing DOM element.

To easily obtain the element's scroll position, we provide a `ref` to the `useScroll` hook provided by Framer Motion like this:

```tsx
const articleRef = useRef(null)
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ container: articleRef })

<article ref={articleRef} className="overflow-y-auto">
  {children}
</article>
```

`scrollYProgress` will track the users vertical scroll progress with a decimal number between `0` and `1`, with `0` being the initial starting position, and `1` indicating the user has reached the end of the scrolling container.

For a helpful visualization of `scrollYProgress` in action, here we can see our scroll progress updating in real-time on a simulated article:

<ArticleProgress />

<Note>
  We're only tackling vertical scrolling for now, but rest assured —
  we'll address horizontal scrolling later in the article for some
  [extra credit](#extra-credit).
</Note>

Armed with this knowledge, we can start creating the foundation for our custom hook:

```tsx
import { useScroll } from "framer-motion";

type OptionsType = {
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
};

function useScrollShadows({ ref }: OptionsType) {
  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ container: ref });

  // do something with scrollYProgress
}
```

The hook consumer will be responsible for passing in the appropriate reference to the overflowing DOM node. Now we can start thinking about what this hook should return.

We need to track two different values:

- The visibility of the starting shadow
- The visibility of the ending shadow

We'll call the two values `startingShadowVisibility` and `endingShadowVisibility`. We'll match the behavior of `scrollYProgress` and have each value hold a decimal number ranging from `0` to `1` as well, with `0` meaning the shadow should be fully hidden (`opacity: 0`) and `1` being fully visible (`opacity: 1`).

For the starting shadow, we know it should begin initially hidden to the user and gradually increase in visibility as the overflowing element is scrolled. This actually mirrors the value returned from `scrollYProgress` — which starts at `0` and ends at `1` once the container can't scroll any further — so (for now) we can just alias `startingShadowVisibility` to `scrollYProgress`. Easy!

```tsx
const startingShadowVisibility = scrollYProgress;
```

As for the ending shadow, we know it should begin fully visible to the user and gradually decrease in visibility as the overflowing element is scrolled. This is actually the _inverse_ behavior of `startingShadowVisibility`, as we want the ending shadow to have full visibility when `scrollYProgress` is `0` and gradually decrease as the scroll progress increases.

To accomplish this, we can use Framer Motion's `useTransform` hook to transform the latest value of `scrollYProgress` into it's inverse by subtracting it from `1`.

```tsx
const endingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
  scrollYProgress,
  (latest) => 1 - latest
);
```

Our updated hook now looks like:

```tsx
// from ./examples/snippets/added-progress.tsx
```

Here is another visualization to help us understand the relationship of each value as we scroll an overflowing article:

<BrokenArticleProgress count={3} working={false} />

And there we go! The values are updating as expected. So we're done right?

Look what happens once the container no longer has enough content to actually overflow:

<BrokenArticleProgress count={0} working={false} />

Notice anything wrong? Try toggling the shadows on and off to reveal the issue.

<Important>
  ### _"Wait, why is the starting shadow showing?"_

When `useScroll` is tracking an element that doesn't overflow, the
default value of `scrollYProgress` is `1`. This means that our `startingShadowVisibility` is _also_ `1` and explains why we're seeing the starting shadow fully visible when there's no overflowing content.

</Important>

This revelation will cause us to adjust our logic a bit, as we rely on the value increasing from `0` to `1` to control the visibility of the starting shadow, but if the value defaults to `1` (and never changes), the starting
shadow will always appear.

To account for this, we can use `useTransform` to essentially override the default value for scroll containers that aren't overflowing:

```tsx
const startingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
  scrollYProgress,
  (latest) => {
    const element = ref.current;
    if (element === null) return latest;

    const isOverflowing = element.scrollHeight > element.clientHeight;

    if (isOverflowing) {
      return latest; // preserve existing behavior
    } else {
      return 0; // override the default value
    }
  }
);
```

With that change, we've corrected the edge case of a container that doesn't overflow and we have a working implementation:

<BrokenArticleProgress count={0} working />

Notice both `startingShadowVisibility` and `endingShadowVisibility` are initialized to `0` when the container is not overflowing, and as a result our starting shadows are (correctly) fully hidden.

With that change, here's what our final code for `useScrollShadows()` looks like:

```tsx
// from ./examples/snippets/added-modified-progress.tsx
```

With our shadow logic set, we're ready to move onto the second half of the problem: adding the shadows to the page!

## Positioning our shadows

{/* prettier-ignore */}
{/* <Note>
I'll be using slightly opaque blue elements to illustrate the effect
for learning purposes. When done properly, scrolling shadows should
be subtle (likely using some sort of `linear-gradient()`), and with
the right design they can be a wonderfully helpful addition to
enhance the user experience.

</Note> */}

Let's get started by using our `useScrollShadows` hook that we created and connecting it to an overflowing element:

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useScrollShadows } from "./use-scroll-shadows";
import { cn } from "./utils";

function ScrollShadows({
  className,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{ className?: string }>) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] =
    useScrollShadows({ ref });

  return (
    <div ref={ref} className={cn("overflow-y-auto", className)}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Tip>
  I'll be using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style my markup for these examples, along with a `cn` helper popularized by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com):

```tsx
import { clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

import type { ClassValue } from "clsx";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

PS: I've included an extra section with [Vanilla CSS](#not-a-tailwind-fan) at the end for those interested.

</Tip>

Taking inspiration from this [article](https://www.qovery.com/blog/adding-elegant-shadows-with-react-to-invite-users-to-scroll/), a great strategy to position our shadows is by marking our elements with `sticky` positioning at the beginning and end of our scrolling container and offsetting them with a negative margin to remove them from the document flow:

```tsx
<div
  ref={ref}
  // focus(1:4)
  className={cn(
    "relative flex flex-col overflow-y-auto [--size:48px]",
    className
  )}
>
  // focus
  <div className="pointer-events-none sticky top-0 -mb-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30" />
  {children}
  // focus
  <div className="pointer-events-none sticky bottom-0 -mt-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30" />
</div>
```

On the scrolling container we've added a CSS variable `--size` and set it `48px`. We can use this value to both ensure uniform `height` for our shadows as well as uniform negative margin.

Each shadow will be "stuck" to the overflowing container in their respective positions with `position: sticky` and either `top: 0` or `bottom: 0`.

<ArticleMarkupExample />

And there we have it! Scroll shadows ready to add to your next project. Hope you enjoyed reading. If you only need to support vertical scrolling, you're good to go.

## Final Code

```tsx
// from ./examples/snippets/added-modified-progress.tsx
```

```tsx
function ScrollShadows({
  className,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  className?: string;
}>) {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] =
    useScrollShadows({ ref });

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(
        "group relative flex flex-col overflow-y-auto",
        className
      )}
    >
      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: startingShadowVisibility }}
        className="pointer-events-none sticky top-0 -mb-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30"
      />

      {children}

      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: endingShadowVisibility }}
        className="pointer-events-none sticky bottom-0 -mt-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

But if you're curious about how to extend our implementation to support horizontal scrolling...

---

## Extra Credit

The first thing we'll have to adjust is our `useScrollShadows` hook. Let's add an option to specify the orientation of the scrolling container by adding an `axis` configuration:

```tsx
// focus
type AxisType = "x" | "y";
type OptionsType = {
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
  // focus
  axis: AxisType;
};

// focus[34:38]
function useScrollShadows({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  // rest of code
}
```

Now that our hook has a way to distinguish the intended `axis`, let's extract our original `useScroll` usage into a new hook which we'll call `useScrollProgress`. It will be responsible for organizing our branching code between the different orientations.

```tsx
import { useScroll } from "framer-motion";

type AxisType = "x" | "y";
type OptionsType = {
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
  axis: AxisType;
};

function useScrollShadows({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  // focus
  const { scrollProgress } = useScrollProgress({ ref, axis });

  // rest of code
}

// focus(1:16)
function useScrollProgress({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  const { scrollXProgress, scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
    container: ref,
  });

  if (axis === "x") {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollXProgress,
    };
  } else {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollYProgress,
    };
  }
}
```

For now, it doesn't do much besides conveniently returning the correct `scrollProgress` value for the `axis` that was passed in. But we still have to address how we are calculating the `isOverflowing` variable, which we were previously doing like this:

```tsx
const isOverflowing = element.scrollHeight > element.clientHeight;
```

We'll have to update this value to become contextually aware of the `axis` and the correct way to measure. We can colocate this measurement in the same place we're returning `scrollProgress` by updating `isOverflowing` to become a _function_ instead — which will accept the DOM node and return the correct measurement:

```tsx
function useScrollProgress({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  const { scrollXProgress, scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
    container: ref,
  });

  if (axis === "x") {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollXProgress,
      // focus(1:3)
      isOverflowing: (element: HTMLElement) => {
        return element.scrollWidth > element.clientWidth;
      },
    };
  } else {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollYProgress,
      // focus(1:3)
      isOverflowing: (element: HTMLElement) => {
        return element.scrollHeight > element.clientHeight;
      },
    };
  }
}
```

And with that, we have our first update to support horizontal scrolling:

```tsx
function useScrollShadows({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  // focus(1:4)
  const { scrollProgress, isOverflowing } = useScrollProgress({
    ref,
    axis,
  });

  const startingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
    // focus
    scrollProgress,
    (latest) => {
      const element = ref.current;
      if (element === null) return latest;

      // focus(1:5)
      if (isOverflowing(element)) {
        return latest; // preserve existing behavior
      } else {
        return 0; // override default behavior
      }
    }
  );

  const endingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
    // focus
    scrollProgress,
    (latest) => 1 - latest
  );

  return [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] as const;
}
```

Next up will be updating `<ScrollShadows />` to accommodate the new `axis`.

The first thing we'll do is pass `axis` to our scrolling container as a [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) in order to conditionally apply certain styles to our container:

```tsx
function ScrollShadows({
  className,
  // focus
  axis,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  className?: string;
  // focus
  axis: AxisType;
}>) {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  // focus(1:2)
  const [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] =
    useScrollShadows({ ref, axis });

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      // focus(1:6)
      data-axis={axis}
      className={cn(
        "group relative flex",
        "data-[axis=x]:flex-row data-[axis=x]:overflow-x-auto", // horizontal styling
        "data-[axis=y]:flex-col data-[axis=y]:overflow-y-auto", // vertical styling
        className
      )}
    >
      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: startingShadowVisibility }}
        className="pointer-events-none sticky top-0 -mb-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30"
      />

      {children}

      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: endingShadowVisibility }}
        className="pointer-events-none sticky bottom-0 -mt-[--size] h-[--size] shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

With this update, we're instructing our scrolling container to adjust it's `flex-direction` and `overflow` direction based on the `axis` variable passed in.

Next, let's update our scrolling shadows to also conditionally place themselves in the right position:

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useScrollShadows } from "./use-scroll-shadows";

function ScrollShadows({
  axis,
  className,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  axis: "x" | "y";
  className?: string;
}>) {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] =
    useScrollShadows({ ref, axis });

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      data-axis={axis}
      className={cn(
        "group relative flex",
        "data-[axis=x]:flex-row data-[axis=x]:overflow-x-auto",
        "data-[axis=y]:flex-col data-[axis=y]:overflow-y-auto",
        className
      )}
    >
      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: startingShadowVisibility }}
        className={cn(
          "pointer-events-none sticky shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30",
          // focus
          "group-data-[axis=x]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=x]:left-0 group-data-[axis=x]:top-0 group-data-[axis=x]:-mr-[--size] group-data-[axis=x]:w-[--size]", // horizontal styles
          // focus
          "group-data-[axis=y]:top-0 group-data-[axis=y]:-mb-[--size] group-data-[axis=y]:h-[--size]" // vertical styles
        )}
      />

      {children}

      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: endingShadowVisibility }}
        className={cn(
          "pointer-events-none sticky shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30",
          // focus
          "group-data-[axis=x]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=x]:right-0 group-data-[axis=x]:top-0 group-data-[axis=x]:-ml-[--size] group-data-[axis=x]:w-[--size]", // horizontal styles
          // focus
          "group-data-[axis=y]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=y]:-mt-[--size] group-data-[axis=y]:h-[--size]" // vertical styles
        )}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And with that change, we've adapted our component to support both vertical and horizontal scrolling!

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useScrollShadows } from "./use-scroll-shadows";

function ScrollShadows({
  axis,
  className,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  axis: "x" | "y";
  className?: string;
}>) {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] =
    useScrollShadows({ ref, axis });

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      data-axis={axis}
      className={cn(
        "group relative flex",
        "data-[axis=x]:flex-row data-[axis=x]:overflow-x-auto",
        "data-[axis=y]:flex-col data-[axis=y]:overflow-y-auto",
        className
      )}
    >
      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: startingShadowVisibility }}
        className={cn(
          "pointer-events-none sticky shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30",
          "group-data-[axis=x]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=x]:left-0 group-data-[axis=x]:top-0 group-data-[axis=x]:-mr-[--size] group-data-[axis=x]:w-[--size]",
          "group-data-[axis=y]:top-0 group-data-[axis=y]:-mb-[--size] group-data-[axis=y]:h-[--size]"
        )}
      />

      {children}

      <motion.div
        style={{ opacity: endingShadowVisibility }}
        className={cn(
          "pointer-events-none sticky shrink-0 bg-blue-400/30",
          "group-data-[axis=x]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=x]:right-0 group-data-[axis=x]:top-0 group-data-[axis=x]:-ml-[--size] group-data-[axis=x]:w-[--size]",
          "group-data-[axis=y]:bottom-0 group-data-[axis=y]:-mt-[--size] group-data-[axis=y]:h-[--size]"
        )}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// use-scroll-shadows.tsx
import { useScroll, useTransform } from "framer-motion";

type AxisType = "x" | "y";
type OptionsType = {
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
  axis: AxisType;
};

export function useScrollShadows({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  const { scrollProgress, isOverflowing } = useScrollProgress({
    ref,
    axis,
  });

  const startingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
    scrollProgress,
    (latest) => {
      const element = ref.current;
      if (element === null) return latest;

      if (isOverflowing(element)) {
        return latest; // preserve existing behavior
      } else {
        return 0; // override default behavior
      }
    }
  );

  const endingShadowVisibility = useTransform(
    scrollProgress,
    (latest) => 1 - latest
  );

  return [startingShadowVisibility, endingShadowVisibility] as const;
}

function useScrollProgress({ ref, axis }: OptionsType) {
  const { scrollXProgress, scrollYProgress } = useScroll({
    container: ref,
  });

  if (axis === "x") {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollXProgress,
      isOverflowing: (element: HTMLElement) => {
        return element.scrollWidth > element.clientWidth;
      },
    };
  } else {
    return {
      scrollProgress: scrollYProgress,
      isOverflowing: (element: HTMLElement) => {
        return element.scrollHeight > element.clientHeight;
      },
    };
  }
}
```

And, as promised:

}
```
